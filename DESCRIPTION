Authors@R: c(
    person("Kelly", "Bodwin", , "kelly@bodwin.us", role = c("aut", "cre")),

  )
Description: Facilitates easier formatting and highlighting of R source
    code in a R Markdown-based presentation. The main goal of the package
    is to allow users to preserve their code creation process within code
    chunks, then to specify formatting details for the source code, such
    as highlighting of particular syntactical elements.
